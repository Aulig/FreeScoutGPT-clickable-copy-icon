# FreeScout ChatGPT Integration Module (FreeScoutGPT)

This repository contains the FreeScout + ChatGPT Integration Module, which connects FreeScout with the powerful language models of ChatGPT by OpenAI via their API using your own API key. This integration enables the generation of AI-based responses for incoming messages, providing a more efficient and intelligent support system for your FreeScout team.

## Features
- Generate ChatGPT AI-based responses for each incoming message, then edit/polish as needed
- Utilize the powerful ChatGPT language models to improve support efficiency
- Customizable prompt message to set ChatGPT's role (e.g., support agent, sales manager, etc.), associate it with your brand with website links, and provide additional training information and context as desired

## Requirements
To use this module, you will need an API key for ChatGPT, which can be obtained from the OpenAI platform at [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## Configuration and Use
1. Upload the FreeScoutGPT Module ZIP file to your FreeScout Modules folder, rename it to ensure the module's folder is named "FreeScoutGPT".
2. Go to each mailbox you want it enabled on, and add your ChatGPT API key to the module's configuration page.
3. Set a good prompt to describe the role, and add some training info, website and KB links, etc for ChatGPT to consider using in it's answers.
4. Be sure to check the Enable switch at the top.
5. On a conversation page, not the reply page, click the drop-down in the upper right near the message time and choose "Generate answer (GPT)".
6. Then you can copy that answer, click Reply, and paste it into your message, and edit/polish it as desired.
